## Setting Modes

### Enter Calibration Mode:
1. Hold model in equilibrium position unmoving
2. Move left stick to left bottom, right stick to right bottom:
	```
	|    _____        _____    |
	|   /     \      /     \   |
	|  |   .   |    |   .   |  |
	|  |  /    |    |    \  |  |
	|   \˚____/      \____˚/   |
	|                          |

	```
3. Continue to still hold model unmoving for about 2 seconds
	
	
### Enter Glide Throttle Setting Mode:

1. Hold model in air ensuring that wings can move freely
2. Move left stick to right bottom, right stick to left bottom
	```
    |    _____        _____    |
    |   /     \      /     \   |
    |  |   .   |    |   .   |  |
    |  |    \  |    |  /    |  |
    |   \____˚/      \˚____/   |
    |                          |
	```
3. Let go of right stick and move throttle quickly to desired position,
	which is set after two exact seconds
